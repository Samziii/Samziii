## 🌆 About Me

I’m a Computer Science student figuring things out, building skills, and slowly shaping the kind of engineer I want to become.

I’m focused on strengthening my foundations and getting really comfortable with problem solving, both in tech and personal life.

Beyond code, I value balance. I love the idea of early mornings, productive workdays, evening city lights, desk setup, dance on weekends, random travel plans, and building connections. 

I love to focus on steady personal growth, therefore, I’m not just preparing for a job, I’m preparing for the life I want to live.
